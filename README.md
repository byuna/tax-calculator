It's tax season! So here's a super basic tax calculator.

Takes two inputs, your gross salary and any taxes withheld.
Will tell you how much you owe in taxes total and how much more you owe or are owed, as well as your effective tax rate.

Currently, the program only handles single filing. I will implemenet married filing jointly.

Also, this only calculates federal income tax for now.

FICA and state taxes are to be added in a future update.
